**Hi friends...**
>**This repository exists because I decided to read more practical books by analysis.
> My problem in history was, I didn't Know How to read books by analysis.
>  I found a book is named " How to Read a Book " that was written in 1940 by Mortimer J.Adler & Charles Lincoln Van Doren,
>  This book is very useful for me and I decide to read all the books I have read before with the rules recommended in this book.
>  Also, I try to write important notes and rules in this book. maybe later years I OR we need to this rules.**


**Workflow :**
>    - The Issues tab keeps a list of books I should read. If you think I should read a book, open in issues for it and I will read it(probably).
>    - I have read several books to date (All of these books Persian language.), I try reading practical books in the English language.
>    - **I like to have a list of reading books during life.** 
>    - When I'm reading a book, it'll be assigned to me [here's the list of books I'm currently reading](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/Reading-Book/issues)
>    - When I've read a book, I'll close the issue.
>    - I might even comment on an issue with notes about a book.
>    - If you have questions about a book I've read or am reading or want to tell me something cool about a book I'm about to read, feel free to comment on it! 
>    - If you like to see boards of things, [check out the Reading board which shows books as little cards moving along the columns to be read.](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/Reading-Book/projects/1)
